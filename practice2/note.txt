Promise:
     1. A Promise is a object that holds the result of asynchronous operation
     2. syntax:  
                var p= new promise();
     3.Three state available - A.pending   B.fullfilled  C.rejected

     4. resolve: for the fullfilled state.
     5.rejected: for the rejected state.

     6. To access the content inside the promise/to handle the promise
     7.   we use .then() for resolved state
     8.   we use .catch() for rejected state(error handling)




promise.all([]):
     1.it takes array of promise and returns the promises of the fulfilled state.
     2.disadvantages 1 is valiable.--if any false a fuction, false fuction is show in console, not 
        visible true function in console.
     3.How to handle multiple promise simualtenously and ihave to execute the promise at a time :

promise.allSetteled():
     1.It takes array of promise and it returns both.
     2.promise which are resolved.
     3.AS well promises which are rejected


 chain of promise:

     a.advantages:-
                      1.  It holds the result ofasync ops 
                      2. It is possible to create a set of dependent operation, dependent operation 
                         is the result of first will be given as a input  to second

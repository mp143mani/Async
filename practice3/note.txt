Application of promise:
                        1. Fetch()
                        2.

  Fetch():   
           1.It is an alternative to XHR
           2.Fetch takes api as a parameter and returns a promise object 
           Syntax:---fetch("api lin");

           3.The output of above step is a promise, inside the promise the data is in readable stream 
           4. To convert readable stream to the packets of data we have to convert  it into object by using .json method.
           5. The output of .json() method is a promise,so to handle promise we have one more  .then()
           6.
